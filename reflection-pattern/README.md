# Reflection Pattern Implementation with Spring AI

## Overview

The Reflection Pattern is a powerful AI agent design pattern that enables self-improvement through iterative evaluation and refinement. This implementation demonstrates how to build a reflection-based system using Spring AI that can generate high-quality responses by critically evaluating and improving its own outputs.

## Problem Solved

The Reflection Pattern addresses several key challenges in AI systems:

1. **Quality Improvement**: AI systems often generate initial responses that may contain inaccuracies, be incomplete, or lack nuance.
2. **Self-Correction**: Traditional AI systems lack the ability to critically evaluate their own outputs.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Without reflection, AI systems cannot improve their responses through multiple iterations.
4. **Consistency and Reliability**: Initial AI outputs may vary in quality and consistency.

## How It Works

The Reflection Pattern works through a multi-step process:

1. **Initial Generation**: The user submits a query, which is processed by the Generator LLM to produce an initial response.
2. **Reflection**: The initial output is passed to a Reflector LLM, which critically evaluates the response, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
3. **Refinement**: Based on the reflection, an improved version of the response is generated.
4. **Iteration (Optional)**: The process can be repeated multiple times, with each iteration further refining the output.
5. **Final Output**: The refined response is returned to the user.

## Implementation Details

This implementation uses Spring AI with the following components:

- **GeneratorService**: Responsible for generating the initial response to user queries.
- **ReflectorService**: Evaluates the initial output and provides an improved version.
- **ReflectionController**: REST API endpoint that orchestrates the reflection process.
- **ReflectionResponse**: Model class that contains the original query, initial output, and reflected output.

## Use Cases

The Reflection Pattern is particularly useful for:

- Content generation requiring high accuracy and quality
- Complex question answering systems
- Technical documentation generation
- Educational content creation
- Any scenario where output quality and factual accuracy are critical

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven
- OpenAI API key

### Configuration

Set your OpenAI API key in the application.properties file or as an environment variable:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Running the Application

```bash
cd reflection-pattern
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### API Usage

To use the reflection pattern API:

```
GET /api/reflection?query=your-query&iterations=1
```

Parameters:
- `query`: The user's question or prompt
- `iterations`: (Optional) Number of reflection cycles to perform (default: 1)

## Benefits of the Reflection Pattern

- **Improved Output Quality**: Through self-critique and refinement, the system produces higher quality responses.
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: The reflection process helps identify and correct factual errors.
- **Enhanced Reasoning**: The system can improve logical consistency and reasoning in its responses.
- **Adaptability**: The pattern can be applied to various domains and use cases.

## Limitations

- **Increased Latency**: The reflection process adds additional LLM calls, increasing response time.
- **Higher Costs**: Multiple LLM calls increase token usage and associated costs.
- **Potential Echo Chamber**: Without proper prompting, the reflection process might reinforce existing biases.
